I recently worked on an SQL-based data analysis project, extracting valuable business insights from a relational database. Some of the key analyses include:

âœ… Identifying the senior-most employee based on job hierarchy

âœ… Finding the countries with the most invoices ðŸ“Š

âœ… Determining the top 3 highest invoice values ðŸ’°

âœ… Discovering the city with the highest revenue for a promotional event

âœ… Recognizing the best customer who has spent the most

âœ… Extracting details of Rock music listeners ðŸŽµ

âœ… Listing top 10 artists with the most Rock music tracks ðŸŽ¸

âœ… Retrieving songs longer than the average track duration ðŸŽ¶

This project enhanced my SQL querying skills, particularly in JOINs, aggregations, subqueries, and ordering techniques to derive actionable insights.
